To run the EleutherAI GPT-J 6B model on CPU, the memory requirements are relatively high due to the large size of the model, which consists of approximately 6 billion parameters. Here are the approximate memory (RAM) requirements:

For Inference (CPU):
System RAM: You will need at least 32 GB of RAM for running inference on GPT-J 6B on a CPU. This is because loading the model weights (which are around 24 GB) and running inference requires additional memory for intermediate computations.
Minimum: 24-32 GB of system RAM.
Recommended: 48-64 GB of system RAM to ensure smooth performance, especially if you are handling large input sizes or multiple requests at once.
For Training (CPU):
Training GPT-J 6B on a CPU is extremely resource-intensive and slow, and it's generally not recommended without a powerful GPU setup. However, if you attempt to train on a CPU:

System RAM: You will likely need 64 GB of RAM or more due to the backpropagation and gradient storage requirements during training. Additionally, large batch sizes will increase the memory usage further.
Minimum: 64 GB of system RAM.
Recommended: 128 GB of system RAM for smoother training.
Important Considerations:
Swap Space: If you donâ€™t have enough RAM, increasing swap space can provide temporary relief, but this will significantly slow down performance since the swap file uses disk space as virtual memory.
Quantization: To reduce memory usage, you can try 8-bit quantization or other memory optimization techniques, such as loading the model with the low_cpu_mem_usage=True flag.
CPU Performance: While it's possible to run GPT-J on a CPU, it will be very slow compared to using a GPU. For practical purposes, inference can work with enough RAM, but training will be extremely time-consuming.
Example:
Inference Only: You can get by with 32 GB of system RAM, though you might face slow performance or out-of-memory errors if other processes are also using RAM.
Training: Requires 64-128 GB of RAM for training on the CPU, but this is not ideal. It is much better to train on a GPU due to the large memory and processing power required.
If you are primarily using the model for inference and do not plan to train it, focusing on optimizing your inference environment and ensuring sufficient RAM should suffice.
